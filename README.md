# MachineLearningMiscellaneous
Some Miscellaneous Stand-Alone Machine Learning Codes. Mostly from TensorFlow and SK-Learn. 

Some codes written in Google's jupyter-style Collaboratory framework. Nice layout for writing and testing ML codes, but seems a bit slower than Kaggle's similar 'Kernels' framework, have to test it out more. 


Some codes here may not work as stand-alones, like AI_music1, but helpful chunks to get started with.
